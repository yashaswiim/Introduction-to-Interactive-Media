My idea for the final project is to imitate the winner announcement ceremony in Olympic games, but in a smaller scale, like manually assigning the three countries receiving the positions of the winner, runner up and second runner up. As the name of the country is announced, the flag of that country would be raised and their name displayed in the LCD, also the LED assigned to the specific country would light up. 

The way Processing and Arduino would communicate in this project is that announcement of the country will be done through Processing on the computer screen which will send respective signals to Arduino to activate corresponding sensors.

I plan to use the following sensors:
 - the servo motor to raise the required flag
 - the LCD to display the name and the posiion
 - the sound sensor to play some unique sound for each announcement
 - the LEDs
